I'm not aiming for speed or least amount of code, but logical clarity.

Each day is fully encompassed by its respectively-numbered file. Until day 11, I liked the idea of each part being fully encompassed by its function, so there's a lot of duplication. I might go back and change days 1-10 to reduce duplication.

If there is an `/input` page for the given day, the JavaScript should be run on that page.
